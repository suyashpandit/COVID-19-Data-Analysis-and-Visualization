    "In this notebook, as part of the 2nd project named Covid-19 EDA and Visualization of the bootcamp on Data Analytics and AI/ML that I am working on, I will be exploring the dataset that I collected and cleaned in Milestone 1. I will also be transforming the data as needed while doing descriptive statistics and building visualizations on PowerBI. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following measures were created using the DAX query to calculate mean, median, range, standard deviation for new cases and new deaths.\n",
    "This is universal for other metrics, but just putting the queries I created for new deaths but it applies to all descriptive metrics in the powerBI filed uploaded. \n",
    "1. Mean New Deaths = AVERAGE('Covid19GlobalDataCleaned'[New deaths])\n",
    "2. Median New Deaths = MEDIAN(Covid19GlobalDataCleaned[New deaths])\n",
    "3. Range New Deaths = MAX('Covid19GlobalDataCleaned'[New deaths]) - MIN('Covid19GlobalDataCleaned'[New deaths])\n",
    "4. Std Dev New Deaths = STDEV.P('Covid19GlobalDataCleaned'[New deaths])\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar DAX queries were used to obtain descriptive statistical values for other measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "I avoided calculating mode because cases and deaths are highly variable and tend to have multiple repeated values but would be of less significance due to the continuous nature of the covid19 pandemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean would give the average, median per country would be accurate but as I have illustrated in the visualization, using median globally gave me skewed data with median closer to zero because of spikes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Global median clearly showed the spikes that was happening during the pandemic. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fluctuation was seen through the standard deviation and range showed the difference between the highest cases/deaths and lowest ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "I made table visuals and formatted the table for better visualization and aesthetic purposes for the following metrics:\n",
    "\t• Mean New Cases\n",
    "\t• Median New Cases\n",
    "\t• Std Dev New Cases\n",
    "\t• Range New Cases\n",
    "\t• Mean New Deaths\n",
    "\t• Median New Deaths\n",
    "\t• Std Dev New Deaths\n",
    "\t• Range New Deaths\n",
    "\t• Total Cumulative Cases\n",
    "\t• Total Cumulative Deaths\n",
    "\n",
    "I used KPI cards for total cumulative cases, toal cumulative deaths, mean of hospital admission in 7 days globally, people who got atleast first dose of covide vaccine by mid 2023 and the average vaccination coverage which calculated the average of each country's vaccination coverage. \n",
    "\n",
    "I created a new measure where I changed the summation of vaccine coverage percentage to average percentage to obtain this using powerBI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the close to zero median in global deaths and cases, I created a new table with only 11 countries with varied deaths and cases which clearly showed that: \n",
    "Median values for individual countries which had large outbreaks, like US and India are high compared to the countries which had low population and also had low reporting. There are many countries with zero cases or deaths especially during the early days of the pandemic as seen in the dataset. This also presents the concept of data being skewed (ups and downs in values really quick). That is why I attempted to see the individual countries. \n",
    "\n",
    "The third visualization with line chart depicting the gradual increase in global new cases upto early 2022 and the decrease after that shows that COVID-19 cases decreased after 2022. Deaths had already started decreasing as per the line chart in the same visualization which shows that people had starting adopting vaccine and masking mandates. Vaccine acceptance and more preventative measures being affected is reflected in this line chart as the case and death both decrease. \n",
    "\n",
    "The fourth visualization was my effort in trying to show the total cases ever handled by the top 10 countries. \n",
    "I ran into a hurdle where I was having illogical values of 880 billion for total cases while the world population is 8 billion. This made me think and I realised that I had actually used the cumulative values of the total cases. Even on using new cases, it would not give me a trend analysis, so I created a new measure to just have total deaths by country using this DAX query: \n",
    "\n",
    "Total Deaths by Country = CALCULATE(MAX('Covid19GlobalDataCleaned'[Cumulative deaths]),REMOVEFILTERS('Covid19GlobalDataCleaned'[Date]))\n",
    "\n",
    "One very interesting insight is the uptick in the total cases from China in 2023 which is clearly due to under-reporting by China during the pandemic. WHO probably had to adjust the previous values in this quarterly report, which showed that China had this sudden uptick. This can be accessed interactively in the PowerBI interface file that I uploaded. \n",
    "\n",
    "The fifth visualization has two bar charts.\n",
    "1. Total Deaths of top 10 countries by death\n",
    "2. Countries with number of people getting atleast one dose\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an attempt to show that since China always had less data coming out of the country formally, there is very less death reported despite China being the origin and having many death reports in the media. Objectively looking, China is not even in the top 10 countries with death. \n",
    "\n",
    "But China is in the first place for vaccine coverage for atleast one dose. This could be due to China having the first vaccine Sinovac during the pandemic (information I obtained while working as a healthcare professional). This was insightful because immediately follows India in second place who also started its own production of the Astrageneca vaccine from the UK. United States having less vaccine coverage is due to vaccine hesitancy in the country. \n",
    "\n",
    "While there is no clear indication of increased vaccination and lower death rates based on the limited data from WHO with many flawed datasets, I think the vaccine accessibilty, poverty level and demographic and cultural factors cannot be ignored. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hospital Admission and ICU admission dataset was not of much value although it was obtained and cleaned. \n",
    "\n",
    "I conclude my visualization and this notebook with a bubble map where I have included the total cases in tool tips which can be viewed by hovering around the bubble. "
