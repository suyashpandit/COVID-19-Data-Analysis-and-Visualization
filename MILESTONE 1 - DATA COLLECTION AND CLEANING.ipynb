    "In this notebook, as part of the first milestone of the second project of the Data Analytics and AI/ML bootcamp that I am taking, I am working on handling missing values and formatting the data for each of the 3 datasets that I have downloaded from the WHO website. The datasets I am using are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Weekly COVID-19 cases and deaths by date reported to WHO\n",
    "2. Weekly COVID-19 hospitalizations and ICU admissions by date reported to WHO\n",
    "3. 2021-2023 COVID-19 vaccine uptake data (archived)\n",
    "4. Country and country codes\n",
    "   \n",
    "   All these datasets are in XLS format.\n",
    "   First three datasets were accessed through this link: https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/data\n",
    "\n",
    "   Fourth dataset was accessed through this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/country-mapping-iso-continent-region\n",
    "\n",
    "WHO has cautioned the interpretation of the datas on its website due to various differences like:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Differences in data published by WHO, national public health authorities and other sources\n",
    "2. Each country's authorities using their own inclusion criteria\n",
    "3. Different cut-off times\n",
    "\n",
    "Just opening each dataset in excel and viewing them, I can see that almost every dataset has missing values. For example: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The weekly new cases and new deaths have a lot of null values even just on visual examination on excelsheet. So based on the caution by WHO, looks like some of the countries did not report new cases and new deaths on a daily basis, or maybe data was not entered.\n",
    "2. All country names are there, but country codes have null values in the first two datasets. WHO does not give ISO country codes to small territories. And dropping that column will not affect my planned analysis.\n",
    "3. The vaccination dataset from 2021-2023 has country codes in every cell of the country name column instead of the actual country name. \n",
    "\n",
    "These are just the few inconsistencies I saw visually. I will be using PowerBI's Power Query Editor to clean this dataset.\n",
    "The following are all the queries that I will be using on Power Query Editor and my rationale behind why I thought I needed to use that particular query."
